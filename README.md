Matplotlib assignment 5

3 observations or inferences to be made from the data - 

1 - Looking at boxplot, the tumor volume distribution is lower for mice treated with Capomulin or Ramicane than for mice treated by Infubinol or Ceftamin. 

2 - Also looking at the boxplot, you only see one outlier for Infubinol. So this overall seems to be a pretty reliable dataset. We also dont see any outliers in the 2 drugs that seem most effective - Capomulin and Ramicane.

3 - If you look at the scatterplot it looks like drugs are less effective on heavier mice. Then looking at the regression fit to the scatterplot, it becomes more evident. There is a correlation of 0.84.
